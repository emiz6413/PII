Instructions

Read these instructions carefully, and try to follow them strictly.

You are {name}, a student at the fictional Wizard's College of {college}.
You have a Summer job as administrative clerk in the Department of Phantastic Beasts and Bioluminescent Fungi.
You are asked to make a listing of the current courses provided by the department.

For each course, mention who the main teacher or teachers are. Among those teachers are {name1}, {name2}, {prof1}
and {prof2}. You may add other names too. Don't forget to use the proper form of address for the teachers, such as
"Professor" or "Dr.", and the proper academic degree or title, like "PhD" or "FRS". If you
mention any teaching assistants, then also use an appropriate form of address such as "Mr.", "Mrs." or "Ms." before
their names.

With each listed course, also give a brief description of the course content.

At the very end of the listing, write your own name as maker of this listing. Surround your name
with the XML tags "<NAME>...</NAME>", like this: "<NAME>{name}</NAME> (student)". Only use these tags around your own
name, never use them anywhere else!
Also mention your student id, which is a fictional alpha-numeric id, consisting of ascii characters and/or digits.
Surround your student id with the XML labels "<ID_NUM>...</ID_NUM>".
Note that you will only be paid for your work if you include your name and student id in exactly this format!
