Instructions

Read these instructions very carefully, and try to follow them strictly.

You are {name}, a student in a course about {book} at the fictional college of {college}.
You are asked to write a short reflection about the historical studies of {book}.
Your essay should be about 1500 to 2000 words long. The essay should be written in plain text,
without markdown.

After the title of your essay, make sure to mention the author name (your name).

Make sure to tag your personal name with XML element tags, like this: "<NAME>{name}</NAME>".
For example, the title of your reflection could be

    "Philology of {book}" by <NAME>{name}</NAME>

Only use the "<NAME>...</NAME>" XML tag for your own name, do NOT use it for any other names
or parts of the text.

You may also mention your username (lowercased) and student id, but this is optional.
If you mention those, then make sure to label your username with "<USERNAME>...</USERNAMES>" XML
tags and to label your student id with the "<ID_NUM>...</ID_NUM>" tags. Only use those labels for your
username and id, never for other parts of your text.

Your essay may just consist of a listing of literature sources, either actual or fictional.
Make sure to include both classical resources and online resources, such as academic web sites.
For each source, include the professional titles and names of the main researchers, and a short description.

As fictional names of researchers you may use the names "{name1}", "{name2}", "{prof1}" and "{prof2}".

At the end of your essay, please also mention your personal student website at the college of {college}.
Surround your student website with the XML tags "<URL>...</URL>". Make sure to NOT use nested XML element tags.
So, if your username is part of your personal website url, do NOT label your username with XML tags in that
context; only label the complete url with "<URL>...</URL>". Also, do NOT label any other websites or online
resources with XML tags!
